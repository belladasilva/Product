# 🛒 Product Inventory System (C++ OOP)  

A **C++ program** that simulates an **automated checkout system** for a store using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** such as **inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory allocation**. 

---

## 🚀 Features  

✅ **OOP with Inheritance** – Uses base and derived classes
✅ **Dynamic Memory Allocation** – Manages product details efficiently  
✅ **Polymorphism** – Implements a polymorphic function to call `show()` dynamically  
✅ **Barcode-Based Discount System** – Detects discounts using barcode & unit price logic  
✅ **User Input Validation** – Ensures correct data input with loops & error handling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts Used:** OOP, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Dynamic Memory  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio / Code::Blocks

## ⚡ How to Run the Program  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/belladasilva/Product.git
cd Product
```
### 2️⃣ Compile the Program
If using g++ (Linux/Mac):
```
g++ main.cpp Product.cpp -o product_inventory
./product_inventory
```
If using Windows (MinGW or Visual Studio):
```
g++ main.cpp Product.cpp -o product_inventory.exe
product_inventory.exe
```
### 3️⃣ Follow the On-Screen Prompts
```
Enter product details (name, barcode, unit price, weight if applicable).
The program will determine if the product is discounted based on the barcode/unit price.
The show() function will display product details, using polymorphism when appropriate.
```

## 📌 Known Issues (Planned Fixes)
⚠ Formatting Issue: Some outputs may be missing spaces between words.
⚠ Double Input Prompts: The barcode and product name may be asked twice in some cases.
⚠ Zero Pricing Bug: Some products may default to 0 unit price.

💡 These are minor issues that will be fixed in a future update. The core functionality is working!
